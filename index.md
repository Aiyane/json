***The shortest code JSON Parser in history***

***All the procedures are purely functional***

***Easy and powerful hight-order fuctions***

***No external dependencies, good portability***




### Important pacth update

> From 1.5.6, the procedures `array->vector` and `vector->array` move to [Core](https://github.com/guenchi/core) so this json library is dependent it. For reason of portability, you can just copy procedure `vector->alist`'s code into library to remove the external dependencie.
